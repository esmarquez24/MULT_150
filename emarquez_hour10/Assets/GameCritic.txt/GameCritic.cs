   Is the game too easy or hard? - the game is too easy
   What would make it easier or harder? - adding goals the player has to achieve to win/complete the game
   What would give it a "wow" factor? - sound effects for every time a ball goes into its respective goal & when the game is complete
   What parts of the game are fun? - moving around
   What parts of the game are tedious? - not being able to do much, it's more like waiting for the game to end
