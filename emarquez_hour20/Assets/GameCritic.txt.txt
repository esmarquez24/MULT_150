1. The game is too easy. It is easy to doge or phase to avoid obstacles. There isn't really a win factor or set goal. 
2. I would set the time as a stopwatch rather than have it ocunting down and make it so it increases in difficulty as the game progresses. I would also set goals or checkpoints like grabbing a set amount of power ups throughout the game. 
3. Adding game music, sound effect for the power ups and obstacles and a cool effect where the music hollows out when you enter the phase mode.
4. The atmosphere of the game is fun, as well as collecting power ups and useing the phase mode.
5. The short countdown is really tedious as well as the silence throughout the game.
